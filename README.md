## Objective

Try to copy the sentence sorted by the circuit while the time is still up and win the level

## How to play

1. Disable the switch named "STOP" and enable it in order to randomize the char sequence

2. Select the level with the "LEVEL[2-0]" switches (binary logic, meaning level 1 refers to all switches desabled, level 5 refers to switches LEVEL[2] and LEVEL[0] enabled, etc.)

3. Copy the characters following the correct order while the last (from left to right) timer LED is lit

4. To enter a char, use the keyboard or press the buttons

5. If the right char is entered in the right order, a green LED will light up

6. If you finish correctly the copy of the randomized sequence, you win
